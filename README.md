2nd Year MURP

Concentration: Transportation Policy and Planning (TPP)

Having grown up commuting between two small cities & one town, I am very interested in bettering transportation infrastructure in a way that promotes multiple modes of transportation to accomodate the variety of people and needs in any given community. Specifically, I wish to better shared mobility options and infrastructure in order to create healthier communities amid growing populatations.
